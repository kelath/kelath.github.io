### Salt Minion installation
```
wget -O - http://bootstrap.saltstack.org | sudo sh
```
For the master, it’s the same one-liner as for the minions, plus (on Debian/Ubuntu):
```
apt-get install salt-master
```

### Minion config

* Config is in `/etc/salt/minion`
* By default, the minion connects to the master with hostname `salt`
* Edit config to change the master hostname or add the appropriate DNS entry (or add a `salt` entry to `/etc/hosts`)
* Restart minion :
```
service salt-minion restart
```

### Master config

* Edit `/etc/salt/master`
* By default, it looks for minion config in: `/srv/salt/`
* Default options are fine, actually
* Restart the master if you changed something: 
```
service salt-master restart
```

### Authorize minions

* Minions generate their own key-pair upon first startup, and send the public key to the master
* On the master, list the keys with:
```
salt-key -L (or -P for details)
```
* Keys are pending for authorization. Check them, then accept them with:
```
salt-key -A
```
Pre-defined modules listed with:
```
salt '*' sys.doc
```

### Running a script

* Put your script on the master in `/srv/salt/`
* Then run it!
```
salt '*' cmd.script salt://myscript.sh
```

### Specifying targets

* Target is interpreted as a minion id glob:
```
salt 'app_server_*' test.ping
```
* Minion id defaults to the minion’s FQDN, but you can change it in the minion’s config
* SaltStack also gives access to some of the minion’s attributes (CPU type, OS...), and you can target them. These attributes are called 
"grains":
```
salt -G 'os:Ubuntu' test.ping
```
You can define groups in the master’s config (called "nodegroups") and target them:
```
salt -N app_servers test.ping
```
* You can target IPs and subnets:
```
salt -S '10.1.2.0/24' test.ping
```
* You can target "pillars": those are key/value pairs defined on the master and associated to minions.
* And finally you can mix all of the above using an "and/or" expression (this is called a "compound target")

### Home-made Modules

A salt module is just a regular python module:
```python
# mathmagic.py
def pow(x, exp = 2):
 return x**exp
```
* Put it in `/srv/salt/_modules/`
* Synchronize the modules on the minions:
```
'salt '*' saltutil.sync_modules
```
* Then run!
```
salt '*' mathmagic.pow 5 exp=3
```
* Arguments are parsed as YAML, so the function receives integer arguments, not strings :-)

You can schedule commands to be executed at regular intervals
* The master can be configured to store the results of specific commands in a local database called the "salt mine". Minions can query data from the salt mine. 
For example the master can store the IP address of all web servers, and the 
load balancers can query this information for their configuration
* You can store arbitrary values, such as passwords and secrets, in "pillars". They are configured much like SLS files, and they allow you to set key/value pairs for minions in a very flexible way.
* You can authorize specific minions to send specific commands to any minion. This is called "peer communication". 
* You can specify a "returner" when sending a command: instead of returning the result to the master, the returner will save it to redis, mongo, etc. 
* You can configure the "outputter" to format the result of a command the way you want it: json, pprint, raw, txt, yaml...
* There’s an "API" so you can do everything programmatically.
* There’s an event framework that allows you to trigger events: you define "reactors" as SLS files that define how each minion should react.
